Use Yahoo Finance to collect Financial data for Indian companies (min 100 companies).
Convert financial variables into features based on the following ratios.
Current ratio
Debt to equity ratio
ROI (Return on investment)
ROA (Return on assets)
Inventory turnover ratio.
Net profit margin
Perform EDA(exploratory data analysis) on features.
Label the data using the logic given below:
A company is called in stress when its revenue to expenses ratio is less than 1.
Train a machine learning classifier(Logistic regression, support vector machine, naive bays, decision tree ) to predict the classes and get
the correlation of coefficients (weights) with respect to the degree of stress.
Use the ensemble model to predict the final degree of stress.
Evaluate the model on test data with evaluation matrices.
PART B.
Forecast Cashflow for any five companies till the next 4 data points
